            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p class="para">
                Computer programming involves problem solving skills and is considered as an essential skill for todayâ€™s digital world.
                Game based learning has been considered as an effective way for helping others to construct knowledge by playing games.
                By taking this approach learners are more engaged in their learning and have high learning motivation which they can use to apply
                their gained knowledge to real-life situations. Sometimes it is hard to keep individuals interested or motivated when it comes
                to learning and teaching technology related courses. Many people might find it dry and boring which lowers their motivation
                and interest in learning the concepts of programming.
            </p>

            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p class="para">
                This project will involve designing a game to teach programming concepts and implementing the game.
                The game will be created and developed based on past research and work that have been already implemented.
                This game idea will help build a more secure foundation for the basics for the programming language Java which will
                help people easily grasp more in depth understanding of programming. Having each level introduce new concepts will
                help the player build their understanding of the programming language as the game progresses.
